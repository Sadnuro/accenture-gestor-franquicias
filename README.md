# Start up üöÄ
These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Requirements  üìã
In the first place,  you must have Java Version 17, Gradle 7.6.1, and MySQL 8.0.29 on your computer. 
Also you must need some editor code. I recommend you Intellij IDEA Community.
With Java Version 17 and your editor code in your computer the next step its import the database schema in your MySQL workbench. The importation file is located in te folder `db/franquiciasdb-dump.sql` in this repository; if you don't have MySQL workbench look at this [link](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=506568).

### import the database schema 
For importing the database schema on your MySQL, you only open your workbench and follow these steps:

 1. Open your MySQL workbench. 
 2. In the home screen MySQL Connection: `Create/setup new connection` with name `franquiciasdb`. Verify that the `Hostname` is `127.0.0.1` and the `Port` `3306`.
 3. Open created connection and provide access credentials
 4. Click `Server` on the main tool bar.
 5. Select  `Data Import`.
 6. In the `Import Options` section, check the `Import from Self-Contained File`.
 7. Click the  `...`  and navigate to where your MySQL backup file is located, select the backup you want to load, and click  `OK`.
 8. Select the `Start Import`  on the bottom right.
 9. Finally refresh schemas in the sidebar left. A schema with the name `franquiciasdb` should appear.
